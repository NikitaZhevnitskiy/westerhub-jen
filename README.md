#### Description
We wanted to create a web application for Westedals students.
Our goal was to create a platform for posting job and collaborative project opportunities.
We also wished to facilitate communication between students, and also between companies and students.

The navigation bar on the top is on every page on the site.
From the navbar a user can return to the landing page, and go to Projects, Collaborators, or Companies.
If the user is not signed in they can also sign up, or log in.
If the user is signed in the user can also go to their profile or log out.

On the landing page the user is introduced to the concept of the page.
Further down some of the collaborators' experience with using the page will be highlighted.

On the Projects page a user can see the title, picture (if present), creator, short description, and tags of all projects registered on the site.
The page is paginated and shows a limited amount of projects at the same time.
Each project has a "Show" button, when clicked it will send the user to the page of the corresponding project.
On the left side of the page there is a button that sends a logged in user to the page for creating a new project,
a user that is not logged in will be redirected to the log in page.
The user is also able to sort the projects by tags, or search for projects by title.
On the the right side on both this page and the page for a specific project there is space for advertisements to help fund the page.

The page for a specific project shows the date it was published, it's title, picture (if present), creator, description, tags, and contact information.
If the user clicks on the picture a bigger version of the picture is shown.
If the user is the publisher of the project they are also able to edit or delete the project.
On the bottom of the page users are able to leave comments if logged in, and see previously published comments.
On the left side there is a short summary of the profile for the publisher of the project.
