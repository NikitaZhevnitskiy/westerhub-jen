# Read about fixtures at http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/FixtureSet.html

# the way how to define associations between tables are messy
# two cases works:
# user_id: <%= User.find(ActiveRecord::FixtureSet.identify('user1')).id %>
# user: user1


project1:
  description: project description
  user: user1
